# autologin_linux

The Linux implementation of [`autologin`](https://pub.dev/packages/autologin].

## Usage

This package is [endorsed][endorsed_link], which means you can simply use
`autologin` normally. This package will be automatically included in your app
when you do, so you do not need to add it to your pubspec.yaml.

However, if you import this package to use any of its APIs directly, you should
add it to your pubspec.yaml as usual.
